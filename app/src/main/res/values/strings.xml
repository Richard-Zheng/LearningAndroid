    <string name="article_text">An <b>activity</b> is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface. For example, an email app might have one activity that shows a list of new emails, another activity to compose an email, and another activity for reading emails. Although the activities work together to form a cohesive user experience in the email app, each one is independent of the others. As such, a different app can start any one of these activities if the email app allows it. For example, a camera app can start the activity in the email app that composes new mail to allow the user to share a picture. An activity facilitates the following key interactions between system and app.
        \n\n<i>- Keeping track of what the user currently cares about (what is on screen) to ensure that the system keeps running the process that is hosting the activity.
        \n\n- Knowing that previously used processes contain things the user may return to (stopped activities), and thus more highly prioritize keeping those processes around.
        \n\n- Helping the app handle having its process killed so the user can return to activities with their previous state restored.
        \n\n- Providing a way for apps to implement user flows between each other, and for the system to coordinate these flows. (The most classic example here being share.)
        \n\n</i>You implement an activity as a subclass of the Activity class. For more information about the Activity class, see https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities .
